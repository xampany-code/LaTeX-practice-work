### LaTeX Introduction course
A practical work conducted during the summer internship by 3rd DSBA year student Anna Gertsog.
In this document I will detail my experience of the LaTeX markup language and provide a tutorial for anyone who wants to understand how to work with LaTeX.
#### What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is the collective name for a document preparation system. It includes a set of tools that generate print-ready documents (usually in PDF format) from text files written using a special markup language. TeX itself is the low-level markup and programming language which underpins it.

#### Features
Typically, LaTeX is used to write articles, documents, reports and develop presentations. 
This markup language has a number of advantages:

- Easy to type mathematical formulas, design graphs, algorithms and other formulas
- Style, fonts, table layout and drawings are consistent throughout the whole document
- It is free and easy to use
- Since the source document simply contains text, you can use software tools to create tables, figures, formulas, etc

The initial experience with LaTeX should begin with the development environment 

IDE's:
- [Overleaf]
- [LaTeX project]
- [Texmaker]

Guides:
- [LaTeX Wikibook]
- [Overleaf guide]

>Personally, I used Overleaf, it's free and easy to use in the browser, however you can upgrade for a fee to access other features.

#### Main functions
Initially we must declare the type of document 
| Document type| Description|
| ------ | ------ |
| article | For short documents and journal articles. Is the most commonly used |
| report | For longer documents and dissertations |
| book | Useful to write books|
| letter | For letters |
| slides | For slides, rarely used |
| beamer | Slides in the Beamer class format|
Let's take the article as an example:
```sh
\documentclass{article}
```
First of all, we should create a front page properly

```sh
\title{LaTeX is the best }
\author{Your name}
\date{01.01.1970}
```
Then, we create a document in which we will add all the necessary components:
```sh
\begin{document}
.
.
.
\end{document}
```

After this, we can create a new page and table of contents:

```sh
\newpage
\tableofcontents
```
All chapters are added to the table of contents automatically, so there is no need to deal with this function separately.
For each section, we simply create 
```sh
\section{LaTeX is the best}
```
Then the section name goes in the table of contents and we get this:
#### LaTeX is the best

In the section we can add any subsections,
```sh
\\subsection{...}
```
any text, and different types of formatting can be tried out.

Let's start with text styles, in my opinion, the most important are **bold** and _italics_
we can add them using:
```sh
\textbf{Bold text}
\textit{Italic}
```
Also, some more important things:
```sh
\\ - new line
\indent\setlength{\parindent}{1em} - creates an indent at the front of the line
```
#### List creation

Many different lists can be created in LaTeX, which are also easy to use...
```sh
\begin{enumerate}  
	\item The first item 
	\item The second item 
	\item The third item
\end{enumerate}
```
it will look like
1. The first item
2. The second item
3. The third item

or we can use
```sh
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item The first item 
	\item The second item 
	\item The third
\end{itemize}
```
and it will look like

- The first item
- The second item
- The third item

#### Tables
Tables can be created in different ways, it just depends on what you want to make.
Initially, we create a table using this command:
```sh
\begin{tabular}
.
.
.
\end{tabular}
```
In more detail, we start with {c c c} which means that all elements will be formatted in the centre, if we want to shift to the right or left, we use r or l accordingly. 
All elements are separated by columns using the & element, and it is also important to use the newline transition \\

To divide it into lines, we use:
```sh
\begin{tabular}{c | c | c}
  1 & 2 & 3 \\
  4 & 5 & 6 \\
  7 & 8 & 9 \\
\end{tabular} \\
```
Also, it is possible to color your table
```sh
\rowcolors{1}{blue}{red}
```

#### Formulas

Probably the most important part for students and researchers who write articles is the use of formulas.
In my opinion, one of the most useful source is [Wikibox]
The most important symbols:
```sh
\frac{}{} - fraction

\int - integral

\sqrt - square root

\sum_{i=1}^{n} - sum

\[\begin{matrix}
  a & b & c \\
  d & e & f \\
  g & h & i
 \end{matrix}\] - matrix
```
All equations are usually allocated separately using:
```sh
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}
```
if you just want to highlight expressions that use mathematical symbols, then use
```sh
\begin{math}

\end{math}
```
In general, all the formulas you need are learnt as you apply them, you can always use the website I mentioned above and just google the symbols you need.

#### Images
Images are also an indispensable part of any document, when talking about uploading to Overleaf, you should first upload the desired image and then use code to link to the image
```sh
 \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{images/caracal.jpeg}
```
![](https://g2.delphi.lv/images/pix/676x385/1O2BjvVguG8/caracal-gosha-big-floppa-53258705.jpg)
Here you can see the necessary picture with that cute caracal :З

#### References
Let us finish our article with references
```sh
\begin{thebibliography}{10}
\bibitem I love HSE
\end{thebibliography}
```
We use thebibliography value to automatically create a reference list, {10} - any number can be chosen, the maximum value of the rows we want to add. Using \bibitem we add the necessary book or link, the principle is the same as with lists.

#### Conclusion

Thank you for reading my article to the end! I hope it was useful to someone and that it will be useful in the future.
